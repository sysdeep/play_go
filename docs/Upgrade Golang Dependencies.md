How To Upgrade Golang Dependencies
Regardless of whether you are using Go modules or not, upgrading Go dependencies is a trivial task by using the go get command. Hereâ€™s a couple of example on how to upgrade Go dependencies


How to upgrade dependency to the latest version
This command will eventually update your go.mod and go.sum file

go get example.com/pkg
How to upgrade dependency and all its dependencies to the latest version
Similarly if you need to upgrade ta dependency and all its sub dependencies to latest version

go get -u example.com/pkg
How to view available dependency upgrades
To view available minor and patch upgrades for all direct and indirect dependencies

go list -u -m all
How to upgrade all dependencies at once
To upgrade all dependencies at once for a given module, just run the following from the root directory of your module

This upgrades to the latest or minor patch release

go get -u ./...
To also upgrade test dependencies

go get -t -u ./...
How to upgrade to a specific version using Go modules
Using the same mechanism as described above we can use the go get command to upgrade to a specific dependency

get foo@v1.6.2
or specifying a commit hash

go get foo@e3702bed2
or you can explore further semantics defined in the Module Queries

Test after upgrading dependencies
To make sure your packages are working correctly after an upgrade you may want to run the following command to test that are working properly

go test all
